# DTMF Rust

This program decodes DTMF signals straight from the microphone and prints the result in the console in real-time. It is written in Rust, a powerful and efficient programming language. If you're interested in DTMF signal processing or Rust development, this project might be a great starting point for you.

## Installation

To run the program, you first need to clone the repository and navigate into the project directory using the following command:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/denizsincar29/dtmf_rust.git
cd dtmf_rust
```

The program uses Cargo, the package manager and build system for Rust, to handle dependencies and build the project. Make sure you have Rust and Cargo installed on your system. You can install Rust by following the instructions provided on the [official Rust website](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

Once you have Rust and Cargo set up, you can use the following command to run the program in release mode:

```shell
cargo run --release
```

Please note that the program does not currently support sound device selection and listing.
